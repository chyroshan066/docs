If you want to create immediate visual feedback for users during data fetching or page transitions, then we use loading UI.
<br> For that we simply, create "loading.tsx/loading.jsx" file in the route folder at which we intend to show the loading UI. Whatever is written in this file, will be displayed during loading period while navigating to that route.
